<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hello, I am Shaokang, currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology at [SUSTech](https://sustech.edu.cn) in China. I maintain a robust academic record, boasting a GPA of 3.72 out of 4, placing me at the 48th position among 218 fellow students.

Following the guidance of my supervisor [Yinqian Zhang](https://yinqian.org/) in [Teecert Lab](https://teecertlabs.com/team/), my academic journey is underscored by a deep passion for research in the realms of **Blockchain**, **Consensus Algorithms**, and **Distributed Systems**. I have actively contributed to the development of various research papers on these subjects, a testament to my dedication and expertise.

In addition to my research endeavors, I have cultivated a solid foundation in programming languages, including Golang, C++, Java, and Python. My proficiency extends to essential tools like Git and Linux, enabling me to navigate the complex landscape of computer science with ease.

  - Propose PHOENIX, which unburdens Multi-BFT consensus from expensive global ordering.
  - Considering transaction dependencies between instances, we deploy a transaction detecting and partitioning mechanism.
- *2022.09 - now*, Collaborator / **Confidential Blockchain**
  - Aim to enhance the security of blockchain technology by combining TEE with blockchain.
  - It can mitigate the security risks and enhance the overall security of the blockchain network.
- *2023.09 - now*, Leader / **Multi-BFT scaling based on TEE**
  - Explore the use of TEE, using both software and hardware methods, to bolster the scalability and security of BFT systems.
  - With leveraging TEE, we can elevate fault tolerance, decrease one consensus phrase, and enhance overall system security.
