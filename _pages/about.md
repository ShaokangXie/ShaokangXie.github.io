# 👤 Short Bio

Hello, I am Shaokang, currently a Ph.D student in Computer Science at [UC Davis](https://ucdavis.edu), advised by Prof. [Mohammad Sadoghi](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/sadoghi/). 
I am passionate about research in **Blockchain**, **Consensus Algorithms**, and **Distributed Database Systems**.

Prior joining in UC Davis, I received the Bachelor's degree at [SUSTech](https://sustech.edu.cn/en) in China, where I worked under the supervision of Prof.[Yinqian Zhang](https://yinqian.org/) and Prof.[Jianyu Niu](https://jianyu-niu.github.io/) at [Teecert Lab](https://teecertlabs.com/team/).

# 📚 Research Projects
- *2022.04 - 2022.09*, Second author / **Byzantine Protocols with Asymptotically Optimal Communication Complexity**
  - With leveraging hash function, we propose a paradigm to reduce the communication complexity of normal BFT protocols.
- *2022.07 - 2023.07*, Co-first author / **Cerberus: High-Performance and Secure Multi-BFT Consensus via Dynamic Global Ordering**
  - Propose Cerberus, a high-performance and secure Multi-BFT protocol.
  - Considering varying block rates of instances, we use timestamp to dynamically order consensus results across instances.
- *2023.04 - 2023.08*, Co-first author / **PHOENIX: Unburdening Multi-BFT Consensus from Expensive Global Ordering**
  - Propose PHOENIX, which unburdens Multi-BFT consensus from expensive global ordering.
  - Considering transaction dependencies between instances, we deploy a transaction detecting and partitioning mechanism.
- *2022.09 - now*, Collaborator / **Confidential Blockchain**
  - Aim to enhance the security of blockchain technology by combining TEE with blockchain.
  - It can mitigate the security risks and enhance the overall security of the blockchain network.
- *2023.09 - now*, Leader / **Multi-BFT scaling based on TEE**
  - Explore the use of TEE, using both software and hardware methods, to bolster the scalability and security of BFT systems.
  - With leveraging TEE, we can elevate fault tolerance, decrease one consensus phrase, and enhance overall system security.
