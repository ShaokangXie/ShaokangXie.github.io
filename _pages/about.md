# 👤 Short Bio

Hello! I am Shaokang, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [UC Davis](https://ucdavis.edu), advised by Prof. [Mohammad Sadoghi](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/sadoghi/) in the [ExpoLab](https://expolab.org/). 
My research focuses on **Blockchain Systems**, **Consensus Algorithms**, and **Distributed Database Systems**.

Prior to joining UC Davis, I received my B.E. in Computer Science from [SUSTech](https://sustech.edu.cn/en) in China, where I worked under the supervision of Prof. [Yinqian Zhang](https://yinqian.org/) and Prof.[Jianyu Niu](https://jianyu-niu.github.io/) in the [Teecert Lab](https://teecertlabs.com/team/).
